```

### Performance Targets
- Page load time: < 1.5 seconds
- Recipe generation: < 3 seconds
- Search response: < 500ms
- Mobile performance score: > 90
- Accessibility score: > 95
- SEO score: > 90

### Security Implementation
- HTTPS everywhere with automatic SSL
- JWT-based authentication with NextAuth.js
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention with Content Security Policy
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- GDPR compliance with data export/deletion

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Real-time error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring with Vercel Analytics
- User behavior tracking with privacy-first approach
- API monitoring and alerting
- Database performance monitoring
- Cost tracking and optimization alerts

### Scalability Plan
- Horizontal scaling with serverless functions
- Database read replicas for query optimization
- CDN caching for static content
- Redis cluster for high-availability caching
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Background job processing for heavy operations
