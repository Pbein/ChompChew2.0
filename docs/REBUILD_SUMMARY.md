3. **Clean Slate** - Start with minimal app shell
4. **Preserve Logic** - Keep all business logic and services intact

### **Phase 1-8: Sequential Integration** (≈35 days)
1. **Foundation** – Core infrastructure & comprehensive testing
2. **Search Foundation** – Homepage search bar & basic results (MVP ✅)
3. **Dietary Needs & Preferences** – Profile page & personalization (MVP 🎯)
4. **Recipe Discovery** – Cards, detail pages, saving (MVP)
5. **Advanced Safety & Dietary Features** – Medical & allergen integration
6. **Nutrition & Macro Features** – Calorie & macro tracking
7. **UI/UX Polish & Premium Features** – Design enhancements & paid AI generation
8. **Integration & Launch** – End-to-end testing & deployment
