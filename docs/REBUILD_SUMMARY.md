## **🏗️ Rebuild Strategy**

### **Phase 0: Preparation** (2 days)
1. **Backup Features** - Move all components/services to `src/features/`
2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Set up Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright, MSW
3. **Clean Slate** - Start with minimal app shell
4. **Preserve Logic** - Keep all business logic and services intact

### **Phase 1-7: Sequential Integration** (28 days)
1. **Foundation** - Core infrastructure and services + comprehensive testing
2. **Search** - Unified search interface + search functionality tests
3. **Recipes** - Recipe display and management + recipe integration tests
4. **Safety** - Dietary preferences and safety + critical safety validation tests
5. **Nutrition** - Macro and calorie features + nutrition calculation tests
6. **Polish** - UI/UX enhancement + accessibility and performance tests
7. **Launch** - Integration and deployment + E2E testing

## **📊 Current Progress Status**

### **Phase 0: Preparation & Backup** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Feature backup preserved (27 features moved to `src/features/`)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure setup (Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright, MSW)
- ✅ Clean slate preparation with minimal app shell
- ✅ Core services and types preserved

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Services** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Basic layout with mission-aligned header navigation with enhanced color scheme
- ✅ Modern recipe card components with safety indicators and hover effects
- ✅ Horizontal scrolling category system with smart scroll indicators
- ✅ Responsive recipe grid layout (1-5 columns) with improved spacing
- ✅ Enhanced visual design with better typography and spacing
- ✅ Comprehensive component testing (26 tests passing)
- ✅ Visual design polish and user experience improvements
- ✅ Smart Semantic Search System integrated on dedicated search page
- ✅ Search store and components properly connected
- ✅ Error boundaries and loading states

### **Phase 2: Dietary Needs & User Preferences** 🎯 **UP NEXT**
- **Objective**: Implement a dedicated page for users to set their dietary profiles, which will persist across the application and influence recipe searches and suggestions.
- **Key Features**:
  - User interface for selecting and saving dietary restrictions (e.g., Paleo, Vegan, allergies).
  - Integration with the search system to filter results based on saved preferences.
  - Clear indicators throughout the UI to reflect the active dietary profile.

### **Next Steps**
