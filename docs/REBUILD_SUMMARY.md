# 🏗️ ChompChew Rebuild Summary

## **🎯 What We're Doing**

We're rebuilding ChompChew from the ground up while preserving all the valuable features we've built. This approach gives us:

- **Clean Architecture** - Well-organized, maintainable codebase
- **Better UI/UX** - Thoughtful design at each integration step
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests for all features
- **Feature Preservation** - All 27 features we've built will be maintained

## **🏗️ Rebuild Strategy**

### **Phase 0: Preparation** (1.5 days)
1. **Backup Features** - Move all components/services to `src/features/`
2. **Clean Slate** - Start with minimal app shell
3. **Preserve Logic** - Keep all business logic and services intact

### **Phase 1-7: Sequential Integration** (28.5 days)
1. **Foundation** - Core infrastructure and services
2. **Search** - Unified search interface
3. **Recipes** - Recipe display and management
4. **Safety** - Dietary preferences and safety
5. **Nutrition** - Macro and calorie features
6. **Polish** - UI/UX enhancement
7. **Launch** - Integration and deployment
