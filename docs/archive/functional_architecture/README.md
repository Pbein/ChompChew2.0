# üèóÔ∏è ChompChew Functional Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for ChompChew's functional architecture and development roadmap.

## üìã **Documents Overview**

### **1. FUNCTIONAL_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md**
A complete architectural overview detailing:
- **Pages & Routes**: All application pages with their responsibilities and data flows
- **Core Components**: Every component with inputs, outputs, and dependencies
- **Services & Utilities**: Backend services, APIs, and utility functions
- **Integration Points**: How all parts connect and communicate
- **Data Flow Architecture**: Primary user journeys and cross-cutting concerns

### **2. DEVELOPMENT_TODO_LIST.md**
A prioritized development roadmap featuring:
- **Priority-based organization**: From core MVP to advanced features
- **Actionable tasks**: Each task clearly mapped to architecture components
- **Sprint planning suggestions**: Organized into 2-week development cycles
- **Definition of done**: Clear completion criteria for each task

## üéØ **How to Use This Documentation**

### **For Development Planning**
1. **Start with the Blueprint** to understand the complete system architecture
2. **Use the Todo List** to plan sprints and prioritize development work
3. **Reference both documents** when implementing new features to ensure consistency

### **For New Team Members**
1. **Read the Blueprint first** to understand how ChompChew works as a system
2. **Review the Todo List** to see what's planned and where you can contribute
3. **Use the integration points** to understand how your work fits into the bigger picture

### **For Feature Development**
1. **Check the Blueprint** to see if your feature affects existing components
2. **Update the Todo List** when you complete tasks or identify new requirements
3. **Maintain the architecture** by updating documentation when you make changes

## üöÄ **Current Status**

### **‚úÖ Completed (Skeleton Phase)**
- Multi-modal search interface (SearchBar + CalorieGoalInput + MacroTargetSliders)
- Comprehensive dietary preference types and safety validation infrastructure
- Complete recipe discovery flow with swipeable cards (RecipeCardDeck + RecipeCard)
- Medical safety infrastructure with trigger food database
- Diet preference management modal (DietQuickSetModal)

### **üéØ Next Priority (MVP Phase)**
- Recipe Generation Page (`/generate`)
- Recipe Generation API endpoint
- Recipe Detail Page (`/recipe/[id]`)
- User Preferences API
- Enhanced SearchBar integration with real data

### **üìä Architecture Benefits**
- **Safety-First Design**: All components prioritize user health and dietary safety
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces throughout
- **Scalable Structure**: Service layer architecture supports future growth
- **User-Centric**: Every component designed to reduce "what can I eat?" anxiety
- **Parallel Development**: Clear component boundaries enable team collaboration

## üîÑ **Keeping Documentation Updated**

### **When to Update**
- **New features added**: Update both Blueprint and Todo List
- **Architecture changes**: Modify Blueprint to reflect new patterns
- **Task completion**: Check off completed items in Todo List
- **Priority changes**: Reorder Todo List based on business needs

### **How to Update**
1. **Blueprint changes**: Update component descriptions, data flows, and connections
2. **Todo List changes**: Add new tasks, update priorities, check off completed items
3. **Keep them in sync**: Ensure Todo List tasks map to Blueprint components

## üé® **Design Principles**

ChompChew's architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Safety First**: Medical safety validation is integrated into every recipe interaction
2. **Anxiety Reduction**: Every feature designed to reduce decision fatigue around food choices
3. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing prevents errors and improves developer experience
4. **Service Oriented**: Business logic encapsulated in services for reusability and testing
5. **User Centric**: All components designed around real user needs and workflows
6. **Scalable**: Architecture supports growth from MVP to full-featured application
