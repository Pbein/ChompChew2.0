# 🏗️ ChompChew Rebuild Plan

## 🏆 MVP Definition
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will deliver the core personalized recipe discovery experience. The following features define the scope of the MVP:

- **Core User Journey**:
    - **Authentication**: Full sign-up and login capabilities.
    - **Guest Experience**: Unauthenticated users can explore, but are prompted to sign up to save recipes. Saved items for guests can be temporarily stored locally.
    - **Homepage**: A main page with a simple search bar and a personalized discovery feed of recipes.
    - **Recipe Detail Page**: Users can click any recipe to view its full details.

- **Personalization**:
    - **Dietary Needs Profile**: A dedicated page for users to set their dietary preferences (avoided/embraced ingredients, diets, macro targets).
    - **Personalized Discovery & Search**: The homepage feed and search results are tailored to the authenticated user's profile.

- **Recipe Management**:
    - **Save Recipes**: Users can save/bookmark recipes.
    - **Cookbook Page**: A page where users can view their saved recipes.

- **Monetization Strategy**:
    - **Gated AI Generation**: The AI Recipe Generation feature is reserved for paying subscribers. This will be built post-MVP, but the business rule is established now.

---

## **🎯 Rebuild Strategy**

**Goal**: Start with a clean, minimal foundation and systematically add back features in a logical order that allows for proper testing, UI/UX design, and integration at each step.

**Approach**: 
1. **Preserve Core Logic** - Move all business logic, services, and stores to a safe location
2. **Clean Slate UI** - Start with minimal pages and components
3. **Sequential Integration** - Add features one by one with proper testing
4. **Design-First** - Focus on UI/UX at each integration step

**Ready to begin? Start with Phase 0 to preserve all our valuable work while creating a clean foundation for the rebuild.** 

## **🏗️ PHASE 0.5: SOLUTION VALIDATION (CRITICAL INSERTION)**

### **Step 0.5: Validate Recent Solutions**
**Duration**: 2-3 days (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE OTHER PHASES)
**Priority**: 🚨 **CRITICAL** - Cannot proceed without validation

**Problem**: Recent homepage issues were addressed with code solutions, but these solutions have not been validated through testing. We cannot assume the code works correctly without comprehensive validation.

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Create comprehensive validation tests for recipe display count
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Create UUID format validation tests  
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Create recipe detail page fallback tests
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Create database integration and seed data tests
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Create regression prevention tests
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Validate all solutions work in different scenarios (empty DB, RLS errors, network failures)

**Test Categories to Implement**:
```typescript
// 1. Recipe Display Validation (8-12 tests)
tests/validation/recipeDisplayValidation.test.ts
- Homepage shows 12+ recipes consistently
- Database vs fallback recipe handling
- Error scenarios with graceful fallbacks
- Recipe data structure validation

// 2. UUID Format Validation (6-10 tests)  
tests/validation/uuidValidation.test.ts
- All recipe IDs use proper UUID format
- No "sample-X" format anywhere
- Database and fallback ID compatibility
- Recipe detail page ID handling

// 3. Recipe Detail Fallback Validation (8-12 tests)
tests/validation/recipeDetailFallback.test.ts
- Fallback mechanism works correctly
- Type compatibility between schemas
- Error handling for non-existent recipes
- Nutrition and ingredient display

// 4. Database Integration Validation (10-15 tests)
tests/validation/databaseIntegration.test.ts
- Seed data script works correctly
- RLS policy handling
- Empty database scenarios
- Connection error handling

// 5. Regression Prevention (8-12 tests)
tests/regression/
- Prevent recipe count regression
- Prevent UUID format regression  
- Prevent fallback mechanism failures
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 12 fallback recipes display on homepage
- [ ] All recipe IDs use proper UUID format (no "sample-X")
- [ ] Recipe detail pages work for both database and fallback recipes
- [ ] Database errors gracefully fall back to sample recipes
- [ ] Seed data script populates database successfully
- [ ] Type compatibility maintained between DBRecipe and fallback recipes
- [ ] Zero regression in existing functionality

**⚠️ BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: Phase 1 and beyond cannot proceed until all solution validation tests pass.

## **🔐 PHASE 0.6: AUTHENTICATION SETUP (DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY)**

### **Step 0.6: Admin Profile & Authentication Foundation**
**Duration**: 1-2 days (HIGH PRIORITY FOR DEVELOPMENT)
**Priority**: 🔥 **HIGH** - Required for testing paid features during development

**Problem**: Developer needs admin access to test paid features (like AI recipe generation) without payment restrictions during development.

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Set up admin user account in Supabase
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Add role column to users table
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Create admin bypass logic for paid features
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Update generate recipe page with role checking
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Test admin access to all paid features

**Database Updates**:
```sql
-- Add role column to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role TEXT DEFAULT 'free' CHECK (role IN ('free', 'premium', 'admin'));

-- Create admin user (replace with your actual Supabase user ID)
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
```

**Code Updates**:
```typescript
// src/lib/auth-utils.ts
export const canGenerateRecipes = (user: User | null) => {
  if (!user) return false
  if (user.role === 'admin') return true  // Admin bypass
  if (user.role === 'premium') return true
  if (user.subscription_status === 'active') return true
  return false
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Admin user created in database
- [ ] Admin can access generate recipe feature without payment
- [ ] Role-based access control working
- [ ] Admin bypass logic tested and functional

**⚠️ DEVELOPMENT BLOCKER**: Without admin access, you cannot test paid features during development.

**📋 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION**: See `docs/AUTHENTICATION_PLAN.md` for complete authentication system plan.
