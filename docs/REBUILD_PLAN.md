# üèóÔ∏è ChompChew Rebuild Plan

## üèÜ MVP Definition
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will deliver the core personalized recipe discovery experience. The following features define the scope of the MVP:

- **Core User Journey**:
    - **Authentication**: Full sign-up and login capabilities.
    - **Guest Experience**: Unauthenticated users can explore, but are prompted to sign up to save recipes. Saved items for guests can be temporarily stored locally.
    - **Homepage**: A main page with a simple search bar and a personalized discovery feed of recipes.
    - **Recipe Detail Page**: Users can click any recipe to view its full details.

- **Personalization**:
    - **Dietary Needs Profile**: A dedicated page for users to set their dietary preferences (avoided/embraced ingredients, diets, macro targets).
    - **Personalized Discovery & Search**: The homepage feed and search results are tailored to the authenticated user's profile.

- **Recipe Management**:
    - **Save Recipes**: Users can save/bookmark recipes.
    - **Cookbook Page**: A page where users can view their saved recipes.

- **Monetization Strategy**:
    - **Gated AI Generation**: The AI Recipe Generation feature is reserved for paying subscribers. This will be built post-MVP, but the business rule is established now.

## **üéØ Rebuild Strategy**

**Goal**: Start with a clean, minimal foundation and systematically add back features in a logical order that allows for proper testing, UI/UX design, and integration at each step.

**Approach**: 
1. **Preserve Core Logic** - Move all business logic, services, and stores to a safe location
2. **Clean Slate UI** - Start with minimal pages and components
3. **Sequential Integration** - Add features one by one with proper testing
4. **Design-First** - Focus on UI/UX at each integration step
