# 🏗️ ChompChew Rebuild Plan

## **🎯 Rebuild Strategy**

**Goal**: Start with a clean, minimal foundation and systematically add back features in a logical order that allows for proper testing, UI/UX design, and integration at each step.

**Approach**: 
1. **Preserve Core Logic** - Move all business logic, services, and stores to a safe location
2. **Clean Slate UI** - Start with minimal pages and components
3. **Sequential Integration** - Add features one by one with proper testing
4. **Design-First** - Focus on UI/UX at each integration step
