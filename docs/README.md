## üéØ **Mission-Aligned Feature Overview**

### **Core Problem We're Solving**
People with dietary restrictions, medical conditions, or busy lifestyles experience daily anxiety around meal planning. The question "What can I actually eat?" creates decision fatigue and stress.

### **Our Solution Approach**

#### **1. Multi-Modal Search** üîç
- **Ingredient-based**: "I have chicken and broccoli"
- **Calorie-focused**: "I need a 400-calorie lunch"  
- **Macro-targeted**: "High protein, low carb meal"
- **Constraint-aware**: "Avoid gluten and dairy"

#### **2. Medical Condition Support** üè•
- **Trigger Foods**: UC, Crohn's, IBS-specific avoidance
- **Allergen Management**: Comprehensive safety validation
- **Severity Indicators**: Preference vs. medical necessity
- **Zero Tolerance**: No allergen inclusion in recipes

#### **3. Intuitive Discovery Experience** üì±
- **Recipe Card Deck**: Swipeable recipe discovery interface
- **Interactive Cooking**: Step-by-step cooking mode with timers
- **Make One for Me**: Custom recipe generation for empty states
- **Personal Collections**: Save and organize preferred recipes
