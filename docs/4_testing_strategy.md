# 🧪 ChompChew Testing Strategy

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

**Test-Driven Rebuild**: We will use a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure every feature is properly validated as it's built and integrated.

**The Testing Pyramid**: Our approach is balanced to maximize confidence and speed.
- **E2E (End-to-End) Tests (10%)**: Simulates full user journeys in a real browser. Highest confidence, but slower.
- **Integration Tests (30%)**: Verifies that different parts of the app (components, services, stores) work together correctly.
- **Unit Tests (60%)**: Fast, isolated tests for individual functions and business logic.

---

## 🛠️ Testing Infrastructure

**Testing Stack**:
-   **Test Runner**: Vitest
-   **Component & Integration Testing**: React Testing Library
-   **E2E Testing**: Playwright
-   **API Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
-   **Coverage**: `v8` (built into Vitest)
-   **Accessibility**: `@axe-core/react`

**✅ CURRENT STATUS**: The testing infrastructure is fully operational with **262 tests across 26 test files**, achieving a **100% pass rate** with comprehensive coverage of all core business logic, components, and validation scenarios.

## 🔬 Test Plan by Feature

This section outlines the testing requirements for each phase of the application, marking what's complete and what's next.

### Phase 1 & 2: Core Services, Auth & Search

#### **✅ Implemented & Well-Covered**

## 📊 Coverage Monitoring & Analysis

### **🔍 Essential Coverage Commands**

Use these commands to get complete testing insights:

```bash
# 1. Full coverage report with file-by-file breakdown
npm test -- --coverage --run

# 2. Find all files with 0% coverage (CRITICAL CHECK)
npm test -- --coverage --run 2>nul | findstr "| *0 |"

# 3. Count files with 0% coverage
npm test -- --coverage --run 2>nul | findstr "| *0 |" | find /c "|"

# 4. Test success rate only (what we were tracking before)
npm test -- --run --reporter=verbose | findstr "Test Files\|Tests"

# 5. Quick coverage summary
npm test -- --coverage --run | findstr "All files"

# 6. Coverage for specific critical systems
npm test -- --coverage --run | findstr "auth.ts\|redis.ts\|openai.ts\|page.tsx"
```

### **🚨 Coverage Red Flags & Action Triggers**

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED IF:**
- Overall statement coverage < 30% ❌ (Currently: 27.89%)
- Any of these files show 0% coverage:
  - `auth.ts` ❌ (Security critical)
  - `redis.ts` ❌ (Performance critical) 
  - `openai.ts` < 50% ❌ (Business critical)
  - Core page components at 0% ❌

**MONITORING THRESHOLDS:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: < 30% overall coverage
- 🟡 **WARNING**: 30-60% overall coverage  
- 🟢 **GOOD**: > 60% overall coverage
- 🏆 **EXCELLENT**: > 80% overall coverage

### **📈 Coverage Analysis Framework**

**Step 1: Run Full Analysis**
```bash
npm test -- --coverage --run > coverage-report.txt 2>&1
```

**Step 2: Check Critical Systems**
```bash
# Security & Infrastructure Check
grep -E "(auth\.ts|redis\.ts|openai\.ts|rateLimiter\.ts)" coverage-report.txt

# User Interface Check  
grep -E "(page\.tsx|layout\.tsx)" coverage-report.txt

# Business Logic Check (should be high)
grep -E "(actions\.ts|Service\.ts)" coverage-report.txt
```

**Step 3: Validate Against Thresholds**
- ✅ Are all security files > 80% covered?
- ✅ Are all business logic files > 90% covered?
- ✅ Are core user journeys covered by E2E tests?
- ✅ Is overall coverage trending upward?

## 🔍 Coverage Monitoring Workflow

### **📅 Regular Coverage Health Checks**

**Daily Development (Before Each Commit):**
```bash
# Quick coverage check
npm test -- --coverage --run | findstr "All files"
# Goal: Ensure no regression in overall coverage %
```

**Weekly Health Check:**
```bash
# Full coverage analysis
npm test -- --coverage --run > weekly-coverage.txt 2>&1

# Check for new 0% coverage files
npm test -- --coverage --run 2>nul | findstr "| *0 |" > zero-coverage-files.txt

# Alert if critical systems still untested
npm test -- --coverage --run | findstr "auth.ts\|redis.ts\|openai.ts"
```

**Sprint Planning Coverage Review:**
```bash
# Generate coverage report for planning
npm test -- --coverage --run > sprint-coverage-baseline.txt

# Count untested files for sprint backlog
npm test -- --coverage --run 2>nul | findstr "| *0 |" | find /c "|"
```

### **🚨 Coverage Alerts & Action Triggers**

**Automated Checks to Implement:**
- [ ] **Pre-commit hook**: Reject commits that drop overall coverage > 2%
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline**: Fail builds if critical files (auth, redis, openai) < minimum thresholds
- [ ] **Pull request checks**: Require coverage report in PR description
- [ ] **Sprint review**: Coverage dashboard showing trend over time

**Manual Review Checkpoints:**
1. **Before each release**: Full coverage analysis with risk assessment
2. **After major features**: Ensure new features have appropriate test coverage
3. **Monthly retrospective**: Review coverage trends and adjust targets

### **📊 Coverage Dashboard (Future Enhancement)**

**Metrics to Track:**
- Overall coverage trend (weekly snapshots)
- Critical system coverage (auth, redis, openai, core pages)
- New files added without tests (flag for immediate attention)
- Test execution speed vs. coverage balance

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero critical files with 0% coverage
- Overall coverage increasing month-over-month
- Critical path coverage > 90%
- New feature coverage > 80% at PR time

### **🎯 Lessons Learned & Prevention**

**What Went Wrong:**
1. **Metric Tunnel Vision**: Focused only on "tests passing" metric
2. **Integration Test Overconfidence**: Assumed E2E tests caught everything
3. **Coverage Report Neglect**: Didn't systematically review coverage data
4. **Risk Assessment Gap**: Didn't categorize untested code by failure impact

**Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Dual Metrics**: Always report BOTH test success AND coverage %
2. **Coverage-First Planning**: Start each sprint by reviewing coverage gaps
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Weight testing priority by failure impact
4. **Regular Coverage Audits**: Weekly review of 0% coverage files

**Culture Changes:**
- "Definition of Done" includes coverage targets
- Code reviews include coverage impact assessment  
- Sprint demos include coverage improvement metrics
- Celebrate coverage milestones, not just feature completion

This framework ensures we never again mistake "tests are passing" for "the system is properly tested." The focus shifts from reactive testing to proactive coverage monitoring with clear action triggers when critical gaps are identified.
