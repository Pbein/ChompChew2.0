# ðŸ“„ Project Overview

## Mission

**To remove the daily "What can I actually eat?" anxiety by providing personalized, AI-powered recipe discovery that respects individual dietary needs, restrictions, and health conditions.**

ChompChew is built for people with dietary restrictions (e.g., allergies, intolerances), medical conditions (e.g., Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's, IBS), and specific health goals (e.g., high-protein, low-carb) who struggle with the constant stress of meal planning.

## Core Features

-   **AI-Powered Recipe Generation**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to create unique recipes tailored to a user's specific constraints and available ingredients.
-   **Advanced Safety Validation**: A multi-layered system that checks recipes against a user's allergens and medical triggers to ensure food safety.
-   **Personalized Discovery**: A "For You" feed that recommends recipes based on a user's saved dietary profile, including ingredients to embrace or avoid.
-   **Advanced Search**: Granular search and filtering by ingredients, nutritional targets, dietary tags, and more.
-   **Saved Recipes (Cookbook)**: Allows users to save, organize, and revisit their favorite recipes.
-   **Dynamic User Profiles**: A comprehensive profile where users manage their dietary needs, which personalizes the entire app experience.
