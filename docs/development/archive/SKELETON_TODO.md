# üèóÔ∏è Application Skeleton TODO

This to-do list focuses on the **breadth-first development strategy** outlined in `CURRENT_STATE.md`. The goal is to rapidly build the application's structural "skeleton" before diving deep into individual feature implementation.

Completing these tasks will establish the entire component hierarchy and user flow, enabling clearer insight and parallel development.

---

### **Sprint 1: Advanced Search Skeleton**
- [x] Create placeholder component file: `src/components/recipe/CalorieGoalInput.tsx`
- [x] Create placeholder component file: `src/components/recipe/MacroTargetSliders.tsx`
- [x] Integrate placeholder components into `src/components/recipe/SearchBar.tsx` to establish the UI structure.

---

### **Sprint 2: Diet Management Skeleton**
- [x] Create `src/types/dietary-preferences.ts` and define core interfaces (`DietPreferences`, `MedicalCondition`, etc.) with minimal data.
- [x] Create placeholder modal component: `src/components/recipe/DietQuickSetModal.tsx` with a basic structure for each section (Embrace, Avoid, Medical, Review).

---

### **Sprint 3: Recipe Discovery Skeleton**
- [x] Create placeholder component file: `src/components/recipe/RecipeCardDeck.tsx`
- [x] Create placeholder component file: `src/components/recipe/RecipeCard.tsx`
- [x] Implement a basic, non-interactive card layout in `RecipeCardDeck.tsx` to visualize the recipe presentation.

---

### **Sprint 4: Medical Safety Skeleton**
- [x] Create service file `src/lib/services/safetyValidationService.ts` with a placeholder `validateRecipeSafety` function.
- [x] Create data file `src/lib/data/trigger-foods.ts` with the basic `TriggerFoodDatabase` structure and one or two examples.

---

## üéâ **SKELETON COMPLETE!**

**All 4 sprints completed successfully.** The application skeleton is now fully established with:

‚úÖ **Multi-modal search interface** (ingredients + calories + macros)  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive dietary preference types** and safety validation  
‚úÖ **Complete recipe discovery flow** with swipeable cards  
‚úÖ **Medical safety infrastructure** with trigger food database  

### **Next Phase: Feature Implementation**

The skeleton provides the structural foundation. Next steps involve:

1. **Connect components to backend services** (recipe generation, user preferences)
2. **Implement actual recipe data flow** and API integration
3. **Add real safety validation logic** using the trigger food database
4. **Enhance UI interactions** (animations, gestures, responsive design)
5. **Add user authentication** and preference persistence
6. **Implement recipe saving/favoriting** functionality

The breadth-first approach has successfully established the entire user journey and component hierarchy, enabling parallel development and clear feature boundaries.
