# ChompChew Application: Current State & Next Steps

This document provides a bird's-eye view of the ChompChew application's current development status and outlines a strategic path forward that prioritizes foundational structure over feature depth.

---

## ‚úÖ **What Has Been Built**

The foundation of the application is in place, focusing on the initial user interaction of searching for recipes.

1.  **Core Ingredient Search:**
    *   A functional and well-designed **Search Bar** is the primary implemented feature.
    *   Users can type in ingredients to search for recipes.
    *   The search experience is enhanced with **autocomplete suggestions** and **ingredient categorization** (e.g., Proteins, Vegetables, Grains), making it easy for users to find what they have on hand.
    *   A corresponding **Hero Section** provides the main landing page layout for this search functionality.

2.  **Backend & Service Foundation:**
    *   The backend infrastructure is taking shape. Essential services for **recipe generation**, **user management**, and **caching** have been created.
    *   This indicates that while the user-facing features are still being developed, the system is being prepared to handle core logic like generating recipe ideas and managing user data.

## ‚ùå **What is Planned vs. What is Missing**

The application is in the early stages of a comprehensive development plan. The following key features, outlined in the technical specifications, have not yet been implemented:

*   **Advanced Search (Sprint 1):** The current search bar is limited to ingredients. The planned **multi-modal search**, allowing users to filter by **calorie goals** and **macronutrient targets**, is not yet functional.
*   **Personalized Diet Management (Sprint 2):** The **"Diet Quick-Set Modal"**‚Äîa critical feature for managing lists of "embrace" and "avoid" foods and setting medical conditions‚Äîhas not been built. The underlying data structures for these preferences are also missing.
*   **Recipe Discovery Interface (Sprint 3):** The core **swipeable recipe card deck**, which is central to the user's discovery experience, does not yet exist.
*   **Medical Safety Validation (Sprint 4):** The specialized **trigger food database** and the **`safetyValidationService`** to protect users with medical conditions like UC, Crohn's, or IBS have not been implemented.

## üèóÔ∏è **Next Steps: Building the Application Skeleton**

To accelerate progress and ensure a robust architecture, the immediate focus should be on **breadth-first development**. This means creating the structural "skeleton" of the application before fleshing out individual features. This approach allows us to establish the complete user flow and component hierarchy early.

| Why It's Valuable                               |
| :---------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Ensures alignment with the big picture        |
| ‚úÖ Helps catch structural or flow issues early   |
| ‚úÖ Makes incremental development and testing easier |

### **Actionable Skeleton-Building Plan:**

1.  **Sprint 1 (Advanced Search):**
    *   Create placeholder component files: `src/components/recipe/CalorieGoalInput.tsx` and `src/components/recipe/MacroTargetSliders.tsx`.
    *   Integrate these empty components into the main `SearchBar.tsx` to establish the UI structure, without implementing the full logic.

2.  **Sprint 2 (Diet Management):**
    *   Create the `src/types/dietary-preferences.ts` file and define the core interfaces (`DietPreferences`, `MedicalCondition`, etc.) without the exhaustive lists.
    *   Create the main modal component file: `src/components/recipe/DietQuickSetModal.tsx` with a basic structure and placeholders for each section (Embrace, Avoid, Medical, Review).

3.  **Sprint 3 (Recipe Discovery):**
    *   Create the component files: `src/components/recipe/RecipeCardDeck.tsx` and `src/components/recipe/RecipeCard.tsx`.
    *   Implement a basic, non-interactive card layout to visualize how recipes will be presented.

4.  **Sprint 4 (Medical Safety):**
    *   Create the service file: `src/lib/services/safetyValidationService.ts` with a placeholder `validateRecipeSafety` function.
    *   Create the data file `src/lib/data/trigger-foods.ts` with the basic `TriggerFoodDatabase` structure, populated with only one or two examples.

By focusing on this scaffolding first, we can rapidly stand up the entire application structure, enabling parallel development and clearer insight into the project's final form.
