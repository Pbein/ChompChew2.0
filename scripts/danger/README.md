**DO NOT RUN ANY SCRIPT IN THIS FOLDER UNLESS YOU:**

1.  **Fully Understand What It Does:** Read the script's source code from top to bottom.
2.  **Have a Current Database Backup:** Ensure you can restore your data if something goes wrong.
3.  **Are Targeting the Correct Environment:** Double-check that your `.env` files are pointing to a development or staging database, NOT production.
